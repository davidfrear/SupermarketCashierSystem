in this section I will use all that I have learned to create this project
creating a mini supermarket cashier software.

- first step accept name of product and the quantity until all entered
- accept membership (depending on type)
- gold membership (20%) silver (10%) bronze (5%)
- finally calculate total.

- starting with creating a simple function
enterProduct() - accepting name and quantity
we will use a while loop
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   subTotal=priceData[product]*quantity
    print(product+':$'+str(priceData[Product])+'x'+str(quantity)+'='+str(subTotal))
    return subTotal

^ once we have defined the dictionary with the product price, we can use that to find the subtotal
^ as we know, the name of the product which will be coming as an argument is the key for the dictionary 'priceData', we can fetch its
corresponding value, that is the price of that product with the help of the product name as the key
^ once we have the price, simply we can multiply it with the quantity which will get us the subtotal amount that we will store in
the 'subtotal' variable.
^ finally we format the data and print it nicely. Some of the data such as price, subtotal, etc are integers.
^ in order to format them and print nicely, we need to typecast them as a strong using the str() method.
^ in the end we return with the subtotal value.
^ that's our getPrice() function with that functionality to calculate the raw price of the products purchased by the consumer.

rough output example
Bread:$2x3=6
Coke:$2x4=8
[Product name]:[$Price]x[Quantity]=[Subtotal]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
creating a discount membership function
getDiscount() which will hav e2 parameters, the total bill amount and the consumer membership

Also, we will add one more condition that a discount will be given only if the billing amount is GREATER THAN $25

gold - 20% off
silver - 10% off
bronze - 5% off

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
creating the bill
LINE 1 = simply define the method makeBill(buyingData,membership) which will need to parameters, the first is the dictionary
of the products purchased and the second is the membership used

LINE 2 = declare and initialize the variable billAmount which will hold the subtotal amount of the consumer

LINE 3 + 4 = calculates the subTotal. As we had discussed that the getPrice() will return the subTotal of just one product,
thus we need to loop through it. We will iterate over the dictionary buyingData and fetch both the key and the value using the
items() method.
- Once we have the key and the value. We pass those to the getPrice() function since we know it will require the product name and quantity
- the getPrice() method returns the subTotal amount, thus we store it in the billAmount variable.
- repeating with all products and adds to the final bill

NOTE = a += b is another way of writing a=a+b ( NO BIG DEAL)

LINE 5 = once subtotal of all products is stored in billAmount, we need to deduct the discount variable.
Thus, we make a call to the getDiscount() function and pass the total bill amount which we have calculated and the membership
which we have got as an argument to the makeBill() function.
--- The getDiscount() function returns the final bill amount which we are storing again in the billAmount variable.

LINE 6 = Finally, we print the calculated bill amount with a message/

This is my makeBill() function with the functionality to generate the bill for the products purchased by the user.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, we will make a call to the enterProducts() function which will set the program into action and will accept
the product details and the dictionary and store it on the buyingData variable.

Once we have the product details, we will need the membership type. Thus creating a simple input statement that accepts membership.
To make the bill the makeBill() funtion will need the prodict details dictionary and the membership.
At this point, I have both. Therefore, making the call to the makeBill() function by passing these parameters.

pseudocode
def enterProduct():  function1
def getPrice(product,quantity):  function2
def getDiscount(billAmount,membership):   function3
def makeBill(buyingData,membership):    Function4
#loop starts:
  -Call function 2 until subtotal is added for all products within buyingData
